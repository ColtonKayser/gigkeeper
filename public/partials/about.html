<p>The Gig Calculator is a tool for freelancers to see how much money they're actually making on a gig.</p>
<br />
<p>The calculator takes all the variables of a gig <span>(pay, time, gas, etc.)</span>  and gives a complete financial breakdown. It will then give a recommendation as to whether a gig is worth accepting. Gigs highlighted green are profitable where gigs highlighted red are not profitable.</p>
<br />
<p>It also saves gigs for future reference.</p>
